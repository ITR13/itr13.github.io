<h1>Aeons of Warfare</h1>
<p>A game inspired by Age of War, because I felt like it.</p>
<p>Then I stopped feeling like it and decided to not work on it anymore, yay. There's basically 0 balancing right now,
    and a lot of features are half-implemented, so I don't think it will be very fun to play :)</p>

    function toggleFullscreen() {

        if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
            iframe.requestFullscreen().catch(err => {
                alert(`Error attempting to enable full-screen mode: ${err.message}`);
            });
        } else {
            document.exitFullscreen();
        }
